## üòû The Problem

Accessibility in New York City's subway system is a critical issue that directly impacts the **independence, dignity, and safety** of countless riders, including people with disabilities, seniors, and parents with strollers. Current solutions to address the frequent breakdowns of MTA elevators and escalators **fail** to provide **accurate, real-time information**, creating **significant obstacles** that leave these riders vulnerable and frustrated. Not only this, riders with language barriers are often excluded from any critical announcements or alert posters, leading to further stress and confusion. When commuting in a city as bustling as New York, the last thing people want is to be confused, lost, or, at worst, **stranded**.

The lack of timely, accurate, and accessible information on essential transit feature status forces riders to confront uncertainty, leading to dangerous situations and a loss of confidence in their ability to use public transportation. Take wheelchair users like Mr. Remigio,[^1] arriving at a station ready to put their already cumbersome commute plan into action only to be met with **non-working elevators**, despite resources **declaring otherwise**. This persistent gap in accessibility undermines the fundamental right to mobility for those who need it most, stripping them of the ability to plan their journeys safely and effectively. Each encounter with unreliable information deepens frustration and distrust, making an already challenging commute even more difficult and disheartening.

**TL;DR**: NYC's subway system faces significant accessibility issues, with frequent elevator and escalator outages, limited ADA-compliant stations, and inadequate support for non-English speakers. These barriers, coupled with a lack of reliable status information, create a **frustrating**, **unsafe**, and often **impossible** environment for people with disabilities, older adults, parents with strollers, and non-English speakers.

## üìù Summary

Over 30 years since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, accessibility in the NYC transit system continues to pose significant challenges. In a world designed primarily for the able-bodied, individuals with disabilities encounter numerous hurdles that extend beyond their conditions.

But the reality is, as accessibility expert Cindy Li notes, ***"We're all just temporarily abled"***. In a society where one in four people live with a disability,[^2] it's important to recognize that everyone will experience some form of disability at some point in their lives. All it takes is a work accident, a trivial injury, or, if you're lucky, the natural aging process. Despite this, as of October 1st, 2024, **only 28% of NYC subway stations are ADA-compliant**,[^3] making it one of the **least accessible transit systems in the nation**,[^4] as exposed by the 2017 Disability Civil Rights class action lawsuit.

Statistics reveal the scale of the problem: 7.15% of the population, or **547,593 people**, identify as mobility disabled;[^5] 2.3%, or **185,378 people**, as deaf or hearing disabled;[^5] and nearly 20% of the city's entire population‚Äî**1.44 million people**‚Äîis aging at 65 years and older with this figure expected to jump to **40%** by 2040![^6] Not to mention the 25%‚Äîapproximately **1.8 million people**‚Äîwho are not proficient in English.[^7]

To paint a picture, the neighborhoods with the ***highest* concentration of disabled residents** also happen to be those with the ***least* accessible stations**.[^8] With a map finding accessible subway stations most available "where poverty rates are the lowest," not surprisingly, those neighborhoods are also where poverty levels exceed **40%**.[^8] With the adverse effects of this inequality compounding with every added social identity, this persistent gap in accessibility underscores the urgent need for a solution that serves all riders. As a lack of accessible transportation remains a key barrier to employment for persons with disabilities,[^5] **hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers** are effectively **excluded** from using public transit, perpetuating a cycle of **social and economic disadvantage**.

The situation is further exacerbated by frequent breakdowns of MTA accessibility features, with about **34 elevators** and **33 escalators** out of service **daily**[^9] and a **single elevator** experiencing an average of **53** breakdowns **yearly**.[^10] On one of those cold days in 2019, a 22-year-old mother, Malaysia Goodson, tragically **lost her life** after falling down the stairs while struggling to carry her baby stroller at the 7<sup>th</sup> Ave subway station.[^11] All because there was no accessible option available and no easy way to find an alternative. This heartbreaking incident underscores a stark reality: **lack of accessibility is not just inconvenient, it's fatal**.

## ü§î Our Hypothesis

If individuals with mobility difficulties and language barriers had access to reliable, real-time accessibility data and translation features, they would feel more empowered to commute via NYC's transit system, safely and effectively.

## üì± Product Overview

Our app, AccessTransit, is designed to address these critical gaps in current transit accessibility features by leveraging **crowd-sourced data** to provide **reliable, real-time updates** on station accessibility. This allows users to plan their journeys safely and assuredly. Additionally, we offer multilingual sign translations to create a more inclusive commuting experience for *all* New Yorkers.

Until the MTA retrofits its elevators with automatic status reporting methods such as sensors,[^10] AccessTransit will step in, allowing users to contribute to reporting the operational status of MTA's elevators and escalators. The app will be user-friendly and employ an intuitive design featuring automatic translation capabilities.

Users will include "riders" and "heroes"- riders can save frequently visited stations, and plan trips based on stations with functional accessibility options. Riders can also achieve "hero" status by reporting the status of accessibility features.

## üèôÔ∏è Mission Statement

AccessTransit exists to enhance the safety, confidence, and independence of mobility-challenged individuals and non-English speakers in using public transportation. By using real-time, crowd-sourced updates and providing accessible information in multiple languages, AccessTransit addresses an accessibility gap to make commuting easier and more accessible for all users.

## ü´Ç Who do we serve?

We intend to serve individuals who are disabled, mobility-challenged, and non-English speakers. Mobility-challenged users will benefit from seeing if a station's elevators/escalators are operational and plan their commute effectively. Non-English speakers will benefit from the app being translated into their desired language, allowing them to navigate the transit system seamlessly.
