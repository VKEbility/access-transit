      <h2>😞 The Problem</h2>
      <p>Accessibility in New York City's subway system is a critical issue that directly impacts the <strong>independence, dignity, and safety</strong> of countless riders, including people with disabilities, seniors, and parents with strollers. Current solutions to address the frequent breakdowns of MTA elevators and escalators <strong>fail</strong> to provide <strong>accurate, real-time information</strong>, creating <strong>significant obstacles</strong> that leave these riders vulnerable and frustrated. Not only this, riders with language barriers are often excluded from any critical announcements or alert posters, leading to further stress and confusion.</p>
      <p>The lack of timely, accurate, and accessible information on essential transit feature status forces riders to confront uncertainty, leading to dangerous situations and a loss of confidence in their ability to use public transportation.</p>
      <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: NYC's subway system faces significant accessibility issues, with frequent elevator and escalator outages, limited ADA-compliant stations, and inadequate support for non-English speakers. These barriers, coupled with a lack of reliable status information, create a <strong>frustrating</strong>, <strong>unsafe</strong>, and often <strong>impossible</strong> environment for people with disabilities, older adults, parents with strollers, and non-English speakers.</p>

      <h2>📝 Summary</h2>
      <p>Over 30 years since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, accessibility in the NYC transit system continues to pose significant challenges. In a world designed primarily for the able-bodied, individuals with disabilities encounter numerous hurdles.</p>
      <p>As of October 1st, 2024, <strong>only 28% of NYC subway stations are ADA-compliant</strong>, making it one of the <strong>least accessible transit systems in the nation</strong>, as exposed by the 2017 Disability Civil Rights class action lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Statistics reveal the scale of the problem: 7.15% of the population, or <strong>547,593 people</strong>, identify as mobility disabled; 2.3%, or <strong>185,378 people</strong>, as deaf or hearing disabled; and nearly 20% of the city's entire population—<strong>1.44 million people</strong>—is aging at 65 years and older.</p>

      <h2>🤔 Our Hypothesis</h2>
      <p>If individuals with mobility difficulties and language barriers had access to reliable, real-time accessibility data and translation features, they would feel more empowered to commute via NYC's transit system, safely and effectively.</p>

      <h2>📱 Product Overview</h2>
      <p>Our app, AccessTransit, is designed to address these critical gaps in current transit accessibility features by leveraging <strong>crowd-sourced data</strong> to provide <strong>reliable, real-time updates</strong> on station accessibility.</p>

      <h2>🏙️ Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>AccessTransit exists to enhance the safety, confidence, and independence of mobility-challenged individuals and non-English speakers in using public transportation.</p>

      <h2>🫂 Who do we serve?</h2>
      <p>We intend to serve individuals who are disabled, mobility-challenged, and non-English speakers.</p>
