# Access Transit

>[AccessTransit](https://access-transit.onrender.com) addresses critical gaps in transit accessibility by leveraging crowd-sourced data to provide accurate, real-time updates on the operational status of elevators and escalators in the NYC-MTA transit system. By giving users the tools to plan their journeys safely and efficiently, AccessTransit empowers them to:
>
>   - View, report, and update the status of elevators and escalators.
>   - Receive alerts and notifications.
>   - Search for stations and save favorite locations and settings.
>
> Additionally, a gamified leaderboard feature incentivizes user engagement, offering "Hero" status to those who actively contribute to reporting and updating transit accessibility statuses. With multilingual text support, AccessTransit aims to create an inclusive commuting experience that empowers users to travel independently and confidently, regardless of their physical or linguistic needs.
